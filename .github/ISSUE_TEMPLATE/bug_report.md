## Summary



## Link to reproduction



## Check List

Please do not ask questions in issues.

- [ ] I've already opened a [discussion](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/discussions) before opening this issue.

Please fill this template if you're filling an issue regarding TypeScript.

- [ ] I've added a link to a [typescript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) or [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io) with a minimal reproduction. Or some other way of reproduction if these two don't suffice.
- [ ] I've read the [typescript guide](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/docs/guides/typescript.md), in particular that `create` is to be used as `create<T>()(...)` and not `create<T>(...)`.
