# Contributing

## Reporting Issues

If you have found what you think is a bug,
and for usage questions,
please [start a discussion].

## Suggesting new features

If you are here to suggest a feature,
first [start a discussion] if it does not already exist.
From there, we will discuss use-cases for the feature,
and then finally discuss how it could be implemented.

## Documentation

If you want to contribute to the [documentation](./docs/):

- [Fork Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/fork) into your Github account;
- Clone your fork locally;
- Separately, clone the [pmndrs/website repo](https://github.com/pmndrs/website)
  (you don't need to fork it);
  - This repo runs most of the doc websites under the pmndrs banner,
    including React Three Fiber and Zustand
  - Switch to the `docs` branch;
- Now, you should have two repositories locally.
- Inside the website directory, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`;
  - This will launch the website locally.
    You should be able to open and see the various documentation sites.
- One little catch here is that the website reads directly from Github, not locally.
  As a temporary measure, you can do the following
  (don't commit any changes made in the pmndrs/website repo):
  - In your own Zustand fork, create a new working branch
    (further related to as `[your-branch]`);
  - Inside website codebase, open `src/data/libraries.ts`;
  - Within the `zustand` key,
    change `docs: 'pmndrs/zustand/main/docs'`
    to `docs: '[your-username]/zustand/[your-branch]/docs'`;
    - For example, `docs: 'chrisk-7777/zustand/docs-test/docs'`,
  - Now, inside your Zustand fork,
    make the appropriate changes to the documentation files in the `docs` folder;
  - Commit and push those changes to `[your-branch]` in your Zustand fork;
    - Commit messages follow the [conventional commits] style.
      See the [committing guidelines].
  - Restart the website locally (`control + c` -> `npm run dev`);
    - Sometimes you may have to also remove the `temp` directory
      in the website directory (`rm -r temp`);
  - Visit the Zustand docs locally
    and you should see the content you've just pushed.
- Once you are happy with your changes:
  - If you are okay with `[your-branch]` name, use it for the PR, or
  - Create a new branch and push the changes to that one.
  - For now there are no formal naming conventions for branches;
- Jump back to the [official repo](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
  and open a PR from the branch you chose.

## Development

If you would like to contribute by fixing an open issue
or developing a new feature,
you can use this suggested workflow:

- Fork this repository;
- Create a new feature branch based on the `main` branch;
- Install dependencies by running `yarn`
  ([version 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install));
- Create failing tests for your fix or new feature;
- Implement your changes and confirm that all test are passing.
  You can run the tests continuously during development
  with the `yarn test:dev` command.
- If you want to test it in a React project:
  - Either use `yarn link`, or
  - Use the `yalc` package.
- Commit your changes (see the [committing guidelines]).
- Submit a PR for review.

[committing guidelines]: #committing

### Committing

We are applying [conventional commits] here.
In short, that means a commit has to be one of the following types:

- **feat**: A new feature.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation-only changes.
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries,
  such as documentation generation

If you are unfamiliar with the usage of conventional commits,
the short version is to simply specify the type as a first word,
and follow it with a colon and a space, then start your message
from a lowercase letter, like this:

```
feat: add a 'BearStorage' storage type support
```

You can also specify the scope of the commit in the parentheses after a type:

```
fix(middleware): change the bear parameter in devtools
```

## Pull requests

Please try to keep your pull requests focused and small in scope,
and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request,
we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.
We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing! :heart:
